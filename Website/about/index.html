            <p class="para">The “FIRMS International Journal of Mathematical Sciences”, published half yearly and going
                to distributed internationally by Forum for Interdisciplinary Research in Mathematical Sciences provides
                a platform for publication of significant applied sciences advancements and developments in mathematics,
                physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, biotechnology, medical sciences and other applications in various
                domains like polymer, textile and interdisciplinary area. All prospective authors are invited to submit
                their original contributions on new theoretical and applied aspects of growing research. All manuscripts
                submitted, including symposium papers, will be peer reviewed by qualified scholars assigned by the
                editorial board.
            </p>
            <p class="para">You are cordially invited to use this journal as a means of dissemination of information on
                the various facets of applied sciences problems; and to impart specialized knowledge, quality and
                excellence to strengthen the perception of technological resources and needs of the world. The FIJMS is
                looking forward to receiving your assistance to working together to develop a worthwhile, high quality

            <h3 class="heading">Aims and Scope</h3>
            <p class="para">The objective of the FIJMS is to provide a platform for communication of information among
                the world's scientific and technological community, scientists and engineers. This journal intends to be
                of interest and utility to researchers and practitioners in the academic, industrial and governmental
                sectors. All original research contributions of significant value in all areas of applied sciences
                discipline are welcome. </p>
            <p class="para"> This journal will publish authoritative papers on theoretical and experimental researches
                and advanced applications embodying the results of extensive field, plant, laboratory or theoretical
                investigation or new interpretations of existing problems. It may also feature - when appropriate -
                research notes,technical notes, state-of-the-art survey type papers, short communications, letters to
                the editor, meeting schedules and conference announcements. The language of publication is English. The
                abstracts should not exceed 250 words. </p>
            <p class="para"> All manuscripts will be initially checked for plagiarism and then peer-reviewed by
                qualified reviewers. The material should be presented clearly and concisely: Full papers must be based
                on completed original works of significant novelty. The papers are strictly limited in length, maximum 6
                journal pages (including figures and tables). This means for the 1st 6 pages there is no page charges.
                However, lengthy contributions may be considered just for the exceeded 6 pages; that may require extra
                page charges. It is advised to keep papers limited to 3500 words.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Research notes are considered as short items that include theoretical or experimental
                results of immediate current interest.Technical notes are also considered as short items of enough
                technical acceptability with more rapid publication appeal. The length of a research or technical note
                is recommended not to exceed 2500 words or 4-6 journal pages (including figures and tables). Review
                papers are only considered from highly qualified well-known authors generally assigned by the editorial
                board or editor-in-chief. Author of review papers should have high qualifications with distinct
                developed research area; an outstanding scholar with an extensive publications. Short communications and
                letters to the editor should contain a text of about 1000 words and whatever figures and tables that may
                be required to support the text. They include discussion of full papers and short items and should
                contribute to the original article by providing confirmation or additional interpretation. Discussion of
                papers will be referred to author(s) for reply and will concurrently be published with reply of
                author(s).</p>
