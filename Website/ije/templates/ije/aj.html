		<h1 id="title">About Journal</h1>
		<p>The “FIRMS International Journal of Mathematical Sciences”, published half yearly and going to  distributed internationally by Forum for Interdisciplinary Research in Mathematical Sciences provides a platform for publication of significant applied sciences  advancements and developments in mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, biotechnology, medical sciences and other applications in various domains like polymer, textile and interdisciplinary area. All prospective authors are invited to submit their original contributions on new theoretical and applied aspects of growing research. All manuscripts submitted, including symposium papers, will be peer reviewed by qualified scholars assigned by the editorial board.</p>
		<p>You are cordially invited to use this journal as a means of dissemination of information on the various facets of applied sciences problems; and to impart specialized knowledge, quality and excellence to strengthen the perception of technological resources and needs of the world. The FIJMS is looking forward to receiving your assistance to working together to develop a worthwhile, high quality journal.
		</p>

		<br>
		<h1 id="title">Aims and Scope</h1>
		<p>The objective of the FIJMS is to provide a platform for communication of information among the world's scientific and technological community, scientists and engineers. This journal intends to be of interest and utility to researchers and practitioners in the academic, industrial and governmental sectors. All original research contributions of significant value in all areas of applied sciences discipline are welcome.</p>
		<p>This journal will publish authoritative papers on theoretical and experimental researches and advanced applications embodying the results of extensive field, plant, laboratory or theoretical investigation or new interpretations of existing problems. It may also feature - when appropriate - research notes, technical notes, state-of-the-art survey type papers, short communications, letters to the editor, meeting schedules and conference announcements. The language of publication is English.  The abstracts should not exceed 250 words. 
		</p>
		<p>All manuscripts will be initially checked for plagiarism and then peer-reviewed by qualified reviewers. The material should be presented clearly and concisely: 
		Full papers must be based on completed original works of significant novelty. The papers are strictly limited in length, maximum 6 journal pages (including figures and tables). This means for the 1st 6 pages there is no page charges. However, lengthy contributions may be considered just for the exceeded 6 pages; that may require extra page charges. It is advised to keep papers limited to 3500 words. 
		</p>
		<p>Research notes are considered as short items that include theoretical or experimental results of immediate current interest. Technical notes are also considered as short items of enough technical acceptability with more rapid publication appeal. The length of a research or technical note is recommended not to exceed 2500 words or 4-6 journal pages (including figures and tables).  Review papers are only considered from highly qualified well-known authors generally assigned by the editorial board or editor-in-chief. Author of review papers should have high qualifications with distinct developed research area; an outstanding scholar with an extensive publications. Short communications and letters to the editor should contain a text of about 1000 words and whatever figures and tables that may be required to support the text. They include discussion of full papers and short items and should contribute to the original article by providing confirmation or additional interpretation. Discussion of papers will be referred to author(s) for reply and will concurrently be published with reply of author(s).</p>

		<h1 id="title">Instructions for Authors</h1>
		<p>Submission of a manuscript represents that it has neither been published nor submitted for publication elsewhere and is result of research carried out by author(s). Presentation in a conference and appearance in a symposium proceeding is not considered prior publication. </p>
		<p>Authors are required to include a list describing all the symbols and abbreviations in the paper. Use of the international system of measurement units is mandatory. 
		On-line submission of manuscripts results in faster publication process and is recommended. Instructions are given in the FIJMS web site:

			<b><li><b>Plagiarism: Definition and Context</b></li></b>
			<p>Plagiarism, where someone assumes another's ideas, words, or other creative expression as one's own, is a clear
			violation of scientific ethics. Plagiarism may also involve a violation of copyright law, punishable by legal action.
			Plagiarism may constitute the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Word for word, or almost word for word copying, or purposely paraphrasing portions of another author's

			<p>Self‐plagiarism, as a related issue, is the word for word or almost word for word reproduction of portions of one's	own copyrighted work without proper citation of the original material. Self‐plagiarism does not apply to publications based on the author's own previously copyrighted work (for example from conference proceedings) where proper reference was given for the original text.</p>
			<p>International Journal of Engineering editorial board will place any plagiarism‐related investigation at high priority and will take appropriate action as needed.</p>
			<b><li><b>Conflicts Of Interest</b></li></b>
			<p>All authors are requested to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest such as any financial, personal or

			manuscript.</p> 
			<b><li><b>Proofs</b></li></b>
			<p>Proofs will be sent via e‐mail as an Acrobat PDF (Portable Document Format) file. Acrobat Reader will be required in
